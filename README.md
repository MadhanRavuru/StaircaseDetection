This project detects staircases in floor plan images using YOLO(You Only Look Once).

# Training for Staircase Detection in floor plans

Detecting single class (stairs) using YOLO Object detection framework. The project uses yolov3 for staircase detection

High quaity architectural images from [Cubicasa5k](https://zenodo.org/record/2613548#.XtDCHMYzZuQ) dataset is considered for training. However, many images do not contain stairs in them. I handpicked some images with stairs for training. Further challenging images were selected from web to generate more robust model for challenging plans.

In the *data/StaircaseDetection* folder, we have the training images along with annotated labels generated using *bbox.py*. As the dataset size is small, we have augmented the images. Even after augmentation, training set has around only 250 images.

The initial weights for model are the weights from coco dataset with 80 classes. Model was pre-trained on coco dataset.

Train using the *Train.ipynb* notebook to get weights for our model. *checkpoints* folder will be created with weights stored for certain epochs. Place them in *config* folder with name *yolov3.weights*.

**Observation**
When the input image has stairs which are identifiable(reasonable staircase size compared to image), we get good stair-case detection.
The model cannot detect very small stairs in a bigger building plan image. We can crop the bigger image to get images with stairs of reasonable size to perform detection.

# Object detection - Testing
We split the testing image into equal parts, as testing for whole image gave bad results for stair detection.
Use splitted images from *images/split* and run *PyTorch_Object_Detection.ipynb* notebook. we get the image with bounding boxes.

Below is the test image of splitted floor plan with staircase detections

We can see that there are some objects which look like stairs, but the model performed well in not getting confused by such objects.

Later, we can merge these splitted images with detections to form full image. Now, we have detections for the full image.

# Stacking floors based on detections

The testing image was diagonally shifted up and down and detections were performed in similar procedure.
Idea is to stack different testing images(original and diagonally shifted) based on maximum overlap in detections.
